Currently working on large-scale generative models at Google Deepmind.

I was fortunate to contribute and lead multiple projects that were featured on Google I/O and company earning calls:
1. Google Veo: video generation model https://deepmind.google/technologies/veo/
2. Magic Editor: generative image model https://youtu.be/cNfINi5CNbY?t=471
3. Google Duplex: conversational AI system that is powering the information behind over 100s of billions of impressions annually. https://twitter.com/Google/status/1662228490387705861
