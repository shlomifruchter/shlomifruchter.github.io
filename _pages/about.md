Currently working on large-scale generative models at Google Deepmind.

I was fortunate to contribute and lead multiple projects that were featured on Google I/O keynotes:
1. [Google Veo](https://deepmind.google/technologies/veo/): text-to-video generation model.
2. [Magic Editor](https://blog.google/products/photos/google-photos-magic-editor-pixel-io-2023/): foundation model for image editing, launched in Google Photos ([video](https://youtu.be/cNfINi5CNbY?t=471)).
3. [Google Duplex](https://research.google/blog/google-duplex-an-ai-system-for-accomplishing-real-world-tasks-over-the-phone/): conversational AI system that is powering the information behind over 100s of billions of impressions annually ([x post](https://twitter.com/Google/status/1662228490387705861)).
